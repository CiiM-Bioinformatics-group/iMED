#### Abstract

Vaccination is the most effective approach to protect against infections. Vaccine-induced protection against influenza is greatly diminished and increasingly heterogeneous with age, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms that differentiate responders from non-responders within the elderly population remain elusive. In this study, we longitudinally examined the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome in a cohort of 234 elderly individuals (>65 years of age) across two independent seasons of the trivalent-inactivated Influenza vaccination. We first identified the system level differences between responders and non-responders and observed time-dependent changes attributed to vaccine response in all the three omics layers in responders, whereas non-responders did not show similar patterns, suggesting dysregulation at multiple layers. Instead, non-responders showed persistent increased activity in inflammatory and senescence pathways at all time points, along with higher neutrophil counts, NK cell proportions and activity. Through multi-modal integration, we identified the key metabolites and proteins that drive a successful vaccine response in the elderly. Examining the pre-vaccination protein biomarkers and their relevance to antibody response, we found that high IL15 negatively correlated to antibody production. Experimental validation in mice confirmed an IL15-driven NK cell axis and its role in suppressing antibody production. Furthermore, we identified unsaturated long chain fatty acids as pre-vaccination metabolites that may modulate persistent inflammation as observed in non-responders. In conclusion, our multi-omics approach identified major differences in older individuals with high IL15/NK cell axis increased in poor vaccine responders. We highlight differences in plasma molecules that allows stratification of vaccinees and can be used as potential modulators for future vaccine design.
